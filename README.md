# Exhaustible Resources

### A mod for Offworld Trading Company

[Offworld Trading Company](http://www.offworldgame.com/) is an "economic RTS"
by Mohawk Games (founded by Soren Johnson, the lead developer of Civilization 4)
about the colonization and economic exploitation of Mars.

This is a pretty small mod I worked on primarily as a proof-of-concept, to find
out just how moddable Offworld Trading Company actually is. As of this writing
(July 2016), there are no other mods out there for Offworld that I'm aware of--
this may very well be the first.

In Offworld Trading Company, you can establish mines and quarries on resource
deposits. But (as in many other strategy games) the resources you are mining never
run out! That low deposit of iron you establish a mine on at the beginning of the
game will remain a low deposit of iron for the rest of the game (unless someone 
detonates an underground nuke beneath it, of course).

This has always struck me as unrealistic (probably because I came into the
strategy genre through Age of Empires), so combined with my curiosity about
Offworld moddability, I decided to see what I could do to change that.

## Installation

## Features

Exhaustible Resources implements one new feature. At the end of every day (that
is, 24 hour cycle), the game will randomly iterate over all tiles with resources
that have buildings mining them.

Currently, there is a 10% chance

### Limitations

* The event messages do not tell you *where* your mines depleted a resource, they
simply say what resource it occurred at. I wasn't able to figure out how to trigger
an event *at* a tile.

(For more accurate information about resource exhaustion, check the Offworld log
file in e.g. C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\Offworld\Logs\).

making a cool (and moddable) game!
